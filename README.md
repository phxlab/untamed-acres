# Information
Untamed acres is an RV Park and campground in Attalla, Alabama. 
They offer RV Sites and primitive camping.
Their logo is Big Foot so try and keep the wild/wilderness as part of theme.
Maybe different SVG of Big Foot, wolves, tents, rv and trees throughout the site.

# Design
Very outdoors feel, think mountains and camping.

## Colors
- #07142C
- #D7692B
- #81432C

And maybe a green too. The colors are not definite so if there are better colors to use, use them.

# Fonts
The heading font should be a bold serif font, see the figma file for the logo font.

Open to any text fonts

# Global
No newsletter for this site

## Navigation

I think maybe the logo in the center and overflowing off the navigation bar.

## Footer
I think the top of the footer would be nice is there could be a treeline with a tent or rv 
and bigfoot in the background. Similar to the style of how we did Xtreme Exotics.
